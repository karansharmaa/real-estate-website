-This is a website for a fictional Real-Estate agent character. 
-Originally this project was for a Web Development class I took while I was pursuing my diploma in Computer Science. However, over the past couple of months, I have added some new things in to this project, and am working on making this into an actual website as I learn more. 
-This is mainly written in HTML/CSS and I've recently added a new script that helps you calculate a rough amount of mortgage you would pay -- should you ever decide to buy 
 a house and are wondering what your mortgage costs would be. (Please note: this is only a calculator like any other and does not represent any real life numbers and situations) 
-The mortgage calculator script is something I wrote on my own with my knowledge of mortgage finance and mathematics. 
-There is also a mini e-mail template script that brings you to Gmail template which would send an e-mail to the Real-Estate agent for an enquiry (will add more to this and turn this into an actual template).
